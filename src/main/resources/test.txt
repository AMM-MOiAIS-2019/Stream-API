The Giraffe
Today I see that your look is particularly sad, 
And your hands are particularly fragile, clasped over your knees. 
Just listen: far, far away, on Lake Chad 
Roams a proud giraffe. 

He has been blessed with gracefulness and bliss, 
His hide is decorated with a magical pattern, 
That only the moon would dare to compete with, 
Glistenting and bouncing on the wetness of the wide lake. 

From a distance he looks like the coloured sail of a ship, 
And when running he glides, like the flight of a gleeful bird. 
I know that there are a lot of miraculous things to see in the world, 
When at sunset he hides himself in a marble grotto1. 

I know the merry fairy tales of mysterious lands 
About a dark maiden, about the fear of a youthful chief, 
But you have breathed in the heavy fog for too long, 
You don't want to believe in anything but the rain. 

And when I tell you about a tropical garden, 
About straight-standing palms, about the unbelievable 
scent of the grasses… 
You're crying? Just listen… far away, on Lake Chad 
Roams a proud giraffe.
